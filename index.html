            <p>Data Scientist at Videobeat Networks. Worked on the development of an algorithm to quantify the impact of TV advertising on website traffic. Starting with a prototype, I used methods from probability theory, wavelet transformation, and machine learning to gradually increase the performance. Followed the entire development cycle from proof-of-concept to delivering the final product as Software-as-a-Service.</p>
